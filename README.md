# Student-Course-Feedback
Open-ended student course evaluations contain rich qualitative information, but are difficult to summarize at scale. In this project, we build an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline that assigns sentiment labels (positive, neutral, negative) to short written feedback comments.

Add files via upload RateMyProfessor_Sample data.csv: The necessary initial dataset used for the file Student_Course_Feedback.ipynb. This block of code:

"import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('/content/RateMyProfessor_Sample data.csv') df.head()"

Enters in the file

The initial code Student Course Feedback.ipynb then yields the file:

student_feedback_labeled.csv

After tokenisation and labelling
